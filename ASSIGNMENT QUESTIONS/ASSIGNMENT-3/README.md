# WHICH STANDARD DEVIATION IS BETTER ? 

# GIVEN:
* Mean (μ) = 55

* Standard deviations: σₐ = 4, σᵦ = 10, σ𝒸 = 15

# 1. What Does Standard Deviation Mean?

Standard deviation (σ) tells us how much the data values spread around the mean.

* Small σ → Data values are close to the mean (more consistent)
* Large σ → Data values are spread far from the mean (more variation)

Since all three cases have the same mean (55), the difference lies only in consistency.



# 2️. Case-by-Case Analysis

##  Case A: σ = 4

* Very small variation
* Most values lie very close to 55
* High consistency
* More stable performance

This means the data is tightly clustered around 55.

Example (marks scenario):
Students’ marks are mostly between 51 and 59 → very consistent.



##  Case B: σ = 10

* Moderate variation
* Values are reasonably spread
* Moderate consistency

Example:
Marks may range roughly from 45 to 65.
Performance varies but not extremely.



##  Case C: σ = 15

* High variation
* Values are widely spread
* Low consistency

Example:
Marks may range from 30 to 80.
Very unpredictable performance.



# 3️. Which is Better?

### If you want consistency and stability:

σ = 4 is BEST

Because:

* Less deviation from mean
* Predictable performance
* Lower risk

### If variation is acceptable:

σ = 10 is moderate

### If you want reliability:

σ = 15 is worst (too much fluctuation)



# 4️. Real-Life Interpretation

###  In Exams:

* σ = 4 → Students perform almost equally.
* σ = 15 → Huge difference between toppers and low scorers.

### In Manufacturing:

* σ = 4 → High quality control.
* σ = 15 → Product defects likely.

###  In Investment:

* Low σ → Low risk.
* High σ → High risk.



# 5️. Important Statistical Concept

For a normal distribution:

About 68% of values lie within:

μ ± σ

So:

* σ = 4 → 68% between 51 and 59
* σ = 10 → 68% between 45 and 65
* σ = 15 → 68% between 40 and 70

Smaller range = more precision.



# 6️. Final Conclusion

Since mean (55) is same in all cases:

* Best → σ = 4 (most stable & consistent)
 Moderate → σ = 10
* Worst → σ = 15 (high variability)



#  Final Answer
If the goal is stability, consistency, reliability, and lower uncertainty:
 σ = 4 is better.
